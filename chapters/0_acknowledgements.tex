\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like first to send a special feeling of gratitude to my loving parents, Ivo and Manuela Rodrigues, to my brother and best friend André, who have been a constant source of support and understanding, teaching me the value of hard work and to aspire for great things.
Secondly, I want to manifest sincere gratitude to my supervisor, and above all my friend, Professor Marko Radeta, for all the assistance and inspiration, passing me his vast knowledge and experience.
I would also like to thank all my friends, family and loved ones who have been an vital part in my life over the past year, this would not be possible without you.
Lastly, I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my deceased grandmother Maria Conceição de Sousa who passed away in the making of this work and had been a great source of happiness and comfort in my life. This is in your homage.
