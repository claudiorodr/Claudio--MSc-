\section{Experimental Setup}

This section provides a hardware and software experimental setup outline, describing and specifying development and implementation of the low-cost \acrfull{ins} aimed at position estimation in three-dimensional space. This section will first describe what actual hardware was used and how it was assembled and going through hardware specifications. Followed by a software walkthrough describing what software and libraries were utilized and how hardware and communicate with each other.

\subsection{Hardware}
\label{sub:setup}

As our projected solution involved a low-cost navigation system, the hardware selection criteria were primarily founded on availability and cost. The cost reduction normally concedes in accurateness and reliability, although with the recent surge of inexpensive, widely accessible, and precise microelectromechanical systems (\acrshort{mems}), that is no longer the case. Still, we aim to employ commercially available tools at the lowest possible cost without compromising the design of a robust and accurate \acrfull{ins}. A LoPy microcontroller was selected as the navigational computing device of the inertial system, meeting the envisioned requirements for low power with flexible and diverse computational capabilities \cite{lopy}. The LoPy development board interfaces with the external physical inertial sensor through connection pins (figure \ref{fig:ins_1}) and communicates remotely by \acrfull{lora} protocol. A PySense expansion board connects with the LoPy module providing a programable interface for the microcontroller. The \acrfull{ins} encompasses a small MPU-9250 (figure \ref{fig:ins_2}).

\end{figure}

MPU-9250 \acrshort{imu} is one of the most widely available low cost commercial \acrshort{imu}s. It is also considered to have an exceptional quality price ratio. The MPU-9250 contains temperature and pressure sensors as well. This chip is extensively employed in wearable sensors for health \cite{majumder2017wearable} \cite{al2019remote}, fitness \cite{altini2016cardiorespiratory}, and sports \cite{rum2021wearable} \cite{morris2008wearable} \cite{ermes2008detection}, motion-based game controllers \cite{heinz2006using}, and portable gaming \cite{mortazavi2013near} \cite{cao2019wearable}. This \acrshort{imu} is operated to estimate motion by identifying the presence of acceleration vectors, rotational rates, and local magnetic field direction. It features an embedded 9-axis \acrshort{mems} sensor from InvenSense. The MPU-9250 is a combined System-in-package (SIP) comprising an MPU-6050 (3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope combination) and an AK8963 3-axis magnetometer \cite{mpu9250}. The MPU-6050 coordinate system operates within a traditional cartesian coordinate system with a counter-clockwise rotation as the positive rotation direction \cite{mpu6050}. The AK8963 shifts the x and y-axis directions, while reversing the direction of the z-axis \cite{ak8963c}. These conventions will be utilized during calibration for each of the three sensors.

\end{itemize}

\input{tables/magnetometer_specification}

\subsection{Software}

The microcontroller operates MicroPython, a barebones and efficient implementation of Python 3, which incorporates a small subset of the Python standard library \cite{micropython}. It is optimized to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments \cite{tollervey2017programming}. The inertial module's raw measurements are interpreted by the microcontroller through \acrfull{i2c} MicroPython driver serial allowing to read the peripherals memory addresses synchronously. The \acrshort{i2c} communication makes use of the \acrfull{sda} and \acrfull{scl} pins of the MPU9250. The \acrshort{scl} offers the serial clock, and the \acrshort{sda} gives the serial data. The memory address of the MPU9250 is at address is 0x68 when the pin is connected to ground and is set by pin AD0. The AK8963's address is by default at 0x0C. Prior to the communication begins the \acrshort{scl} and \acrshort{sda} are equally high, triggered by the pull-up resistors. These pull-up resistors are arranged to make specific pins turn out to be high when not being defined by the LoPy, this avoids communication difficulties when the LoPy is waiting for inbound serial data.
When the transmission between the LoPy (master) and the MPU9250 (slave) initializes the start order is produced. This is accomplished by lowering \acrshort{sda}, see figure \ref{fig:i2c}. Later the \acrshort{scl} commences to produce clock pulses and the initial byte is sent out by the master. This first byte holds the 7-bit address of the slave and a read/write bite. If the read/write bit is 0 the master writes to the slave. If the read/write bit is 1 the master reads from the slave. The bits can only be sent when the serial clock is high. Each byte sent should be followed by an acknowledge bit. When the master is done writing/reading then the stop condition is created.

\end{figure}

The readings of each sensor are later averaged and linearized to better detect and reduce the presence of outlier readings \cite{khamphroo2017micropython}. A fusion algorithm takes as input the averaged data of the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. It returns the estimated inertial angles (pitch, roll, and yaw) as well as the projected linear acceleration with a gravity compensation numerical method that utterly removes the effect of the gravity component. Numerically integrating the resultant linear acceleration yields velocity, and double integrating will deliver the body's accumulative position (more in-depth explanation at chapter \ref{sub:methodology} \nameref{sub:methodology}). Merging the \acrshort{ahrs} with an accumulative position allows tracking a moving body in three dimensions over time. To perform sensor fusion, two methodologies were used: the first relates our implementation of Madgwick's filter to conduct real-time sensor fusion in the microcontroller, which in a future study might be used to communicate in real-time a body's position. The Madgwick algorithm was utilized for its well-recognized proficiency to merge accuracy with computational cost and simplicity of implementation. But since the study aimed at comparing how different sensor fusion approaches perform under the same data, we needed a second approach which meant storing the raw sensor data in an SD card and process it later the experiment with a sensor fusion library, AHRS: Attitude and Heading Reference Systems \cite{ahrs}, an open-source Python toolbox for attitude estimation using the most known algorithms, methods, and resources. To benchmark how different sensor fusion algorithms perform under the same data. Available sensor fusion algorithms in \acrshort{ahrs} library and what sensors they use to perform \acrshort{ahrs} estimation is present at table \ref{tab:ahrs_algorithms}.

\subsection{Calibration}
\label{sub:calibration}

A correct calibration of such sensors is essential for the compensation of their systematic errors, bias, and scale factor. Each time prior to an experiment, the inertial sensor is calibrated while the system is stationary and stabilized to compensate for static error that might corrupt the measurements.

\subsubsection{Accelerometer Calibration}

Calibration of the accelerometer requires taking advantage of the acceleration due to gravity, which we can use in the positive and negative orientation of the \acrshort{imu} \cite{won2009triaxial}. Additionally, we can also position the \acrshort{imu} perpendicular to gravity in order to acquire a third calibration point. This results in three unique values that can be combined to formulate a linear fit between the three values and the values outputted by each axis of the accelerometer.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}  % Start your code-block

    count=256
    aox, aoy, aoz = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    self._accelerometer_offset = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    n = float(count)

    while count:
        utime.sleep_ms(delay)
        # taking samples for a period of time
        ax, ay, az = self.acceleration
        # sum every sample on each axis
        aox += ax
        aoy += ay
        aoz += az 
        count -= 1

    # average the samples taken
    self._accelerometer_offset = (aox / n, aoy / n, aoz / n)
    return self._accelerometer_offset
\end{lstlisting}

The result of the accelerometer's calibration offset correction is present at figure \ref{fig:accelerometer_calibration} where the calibrated output clearly shows an offset correction with the $a_x$ and $a_y$ readings centered at 0 $ms^{-2}$ while the $a_z$ revolving at the 9.8 $ms^{-2}$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \resizebox{0.8\linewidth}{!}{\input{plots/accelerometer.pgf}}
    \caption{Accelerometer calibration offset correction.}
    \label{fig:accelerometer_calibration}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gyroscope Calibration}

The simplest calibration of an \acrshort{imu} consists of calculating the offset for each axis of the gyroscope. The gyroscope is the easiest calibration due to the expected readings outputted under steady conditions. Each of the three axes of the gyro should read 0 radians-per-second ($rad/s$) when the \acrshort{imu} is not moving. The offsets can be measured by first taking some readings while the \acrshort{imu} is not moving, then using those values as 'offsets' when reading the gyro values in the future. This is merely the simplest calibration method for the \acrshort{imu} and suffices for most casual uses of the gyroscope and \acrshort{imu} \cite{olivares2009high}. There are a range of  higher-order gyroscope calibration routines, which can be found at the following links (with application descriptions):
\clearpage
\lstset{language=Python}

\begin{lstlisting}  % Start your code-block

    count=256
    gox, goy, goz = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    self._gyro_offset = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 

    while count:
        gx, gy, gz = self.gyro
        # sum every sample on each axis
        gox += gx
        goy += gy
        goz += gz
        count -= 1

    # average the samples taken
    self._gyro_offset = (gox / count, goy / count, goz / count)
    return self._gyro_offset
\end{lstlisting}

The result of the gyroscope's calibration offset correction is present at figure \ref{fig:gyroscope_calibration} where the calibrated output clearly shows an offset correction with the $\omega_x$, $\omega_y$  and $\omega_z$ readings centered at 0 $rad/s$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \resizebox{0.8\linewidth}{!}{\input{plots/gyroscope.pgf}}
    \caption{Gyroscope calibration offset correction.}
    \label{fig:gyroscope_calibration}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Magnetometer Calibration}

To calibrate the magnetometer, a series of measurements of the nearby magnetic field are taken while holding the sensor in an eight-figure pattern through every orientation possible. Ideally the measurements should portray a perfect sphere centered at the origin and where the radius of the sphere is the magnetic field's strength \cite{kok2016magnetometer}. Plotting the magnetometer's raw measurements (as seen in figure \ref{plt:raw_magnetometer} and figure \ref{plt:raw_magnetometer3D}), it is visible that these do not form a perfect sphere, nor are they centered at the origin. These are referred to as hard iron and soft iron errors or biases, respectively. If no magnetic anomaly algorithm is applied to perceive and avoid it, such distortions in the magnetic field can be interpreted as changes in orientation.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.7\textwidth}
        \centering
        \resizebox{1\linewidth}{!}{\input{plots/magnetometer2D.pgf}}
        \caption{Magnetometer measurements of magnetic field strength along orthogonal X and Y-axis.}
        \label{plt:raw_magnetometer}
    \end{subfigure}

    \begin{subfigure}{0.7\textwidth}

        \resizebox{1\linewidth}{!}{\input{plots/magnetometer3D.pgf}}
        \caption{Magnetometer measurements of magnetic field strength along orthogonal X, Y and Z-axis.}
        \label{plt:raw_magnetometer3D}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Raw magnetometer measurements.}
\end{figure}

Hard iron biases are commonly the largest and the simplest errors to rectify. With the magnetic field measurements, it is straightforward to compensate for hard iron biases by keeping track of the minimum and maximum field measured in $\widetilde{m}_x$, $\widetilde{m}_y$ and $\widetilde{m}_z$. Once the minimum and maximum field measured in $\widetilde{m}_x$, $\widetilde{m}_y$ and $\widetilde{m}_z$ are known, the average can be subtracted from the following data which results in the re-centering of the response surface on the origin. The following script illustrates how a hard iron correction could be implemented:

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}  % Start your code-block

    # Hard iron correction

    # get average x mag bias in counts
    offset_x = (maxx + minx) / 2
    # get average y mag bias in counts
    offset_y = (maxy + miny) / 2
    # get average z mag bias in counts
    offset_z = (maxz + minz) / 2

    self._offset = (offset_x, offset_y, offset_z)
    return self._offset
\end{lstlisting}

It is possible now to filter any soft iron biases by taking the minimum and maximum field measured already computed and manipulate them to rescale the magnetometer data to normalize the output across $\widetilde{m}_x$, $\widetilde{m}_y$ and $\widetilde{m}_z$. It is possible to accomplish this by calculating the scale factor with the ratio of the average max - min through each axis and the numerical mean of all three axes. This means, for instance, if $x_{max} - x_{min}$ ratio is considerable, $\widetilde{m}_x$ has its magnetic field scale reduced, or if the $y_{max} - y_{max}$ ratio is smaller compared to the other axes, it has its magnetic field values increased. This is known as orthogonal rescaling, identical to a diagonalized 3 x 3 calibration matrix while enabling further scale bias correction.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting} % Start your code-block

    # Soft iron correction
    # get average axis max chord length in counts
    avg_delta_x = (maxx - minx) / 2
    avg_delta_y = (maxy - miny) / 2
    avg_delta_z = (maxz - minz) / 2

    avg_delta = (avg_delta_x + avg_delta_y + avg_delta_z)
    avg_delta /= 3

    scale_x = avg_delta / avg_delta_x
    scale_y = avg_delta / avg_delta_y
    scale_z = avg_delta / avg_delta_z

    self._scale = (scale_x, scale_y, scale_z)
    return self._scale

\end{lstlisting}

% \subsection{System Architecture}

% Moreover, the navigation system is equipped with a LoRa antenna enabling the system to transmit at 868MHz/915MHz LoRa bands in real-time at a long distance the position and orientation information to an external gateway (figure \ref{fig:overview}). A visualization of the entire hardware solution is provided at image \ref{fig:full}.

\subsection{Experiments}
\label{sub:experiments}

Several experimental tests were conducted to assess the position performance of the \acrshort{ins} under different conditions. Experiments were performed indoors, outdoors, and underwater. These tests typically consisted of carrying the \acrshort{ins} in a movable platform, typically a skateboard or an electric scooter forming a geometric shape such as a square or a triangle following a precise path on the floor. Geometric shapes were used to better assess the estimating performance of the system against a ground truth baseline. This section will describe how each set of experiments were carried out and what challenges were faced.

\subsection{Indoor Experiments}

Indoor experiments were executed at Madeira Tecnopolo building, floor -1, in a wide-open interior. A guiding rope was layout out in the floor forming a geometric figure acting as baseline for the experiment. The inertial system was placed on an electrical skateboard powered by a laptop computer, which could have been replaced by a portable battery pack. Three kinds of geometric shapes were tested: line, square, triangle. To better understand how distance affects estimation of position, for every geometric figure, tests were made under two different distance magnitudes: 4 and 16 meters.

    \caption{4-meter side ground square used for baseline of accuracy of inertial system.}
    \label{fig:indoor_square}
\end{figure}

Once the experiment was set up, it was time to start testing the \acrshort{ins}. The board was dragged at constant speed through the guideline transporting the inertial system. The \acrshort{ins} was continuously estimating orientation and position several times a second and storing data to an SD card. The board was dragged at walking speed and stopped at corners when direction changed.

\subsection{Outdoor Experiments}

Outdoor experiments were conducted at praça do povo's square (figure \ref{fig:outdoor_field}), in a sport's platform with a guiding rope also acting as baseline for the experiment in the forming of geometric figures on the ground.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}

Here, the sports platform consisted of one 28mx28m square, composed of 4 meter squares, forming a 7x7 grid (figure \ref{fig:platform_representation}). This was helpful since this knowledge could also be used to benchmark the position estimation of the system and easily calculate error margins.

The inertial system was placed on an electrical scooter (figure \ref{fig:outdoor_1}) in this case, being powered by a laptop computer (figure \ref{fig:outdoor_2}). The scooter was dragged at walking pace (figure \ref{fig:outdoor_3}) along the planned path marked by the rope.

\subsection{Underwater Experiments}

Underwater experiments were carried out at Madeira Carlton hotel divepoint, where the \acrshort{ins} was placed in an underwater spherical housing built for 360\circ cameras with a portable battery pack (figure \ref{fig:underwater1_test}). Since the hardware was inaccessible inside the housing, the software had to be adjusted to support remote triggering of the \acrshort{ins} via a wireless hotspot using a mobile phone via an HTTP request signal. Tests of the housing were performed prior to the experiment verifying the presence of any water leaks and the well-functioning of the \acrshort{ins} (figure \ref{fig:underwater2_test}).

Once safety checks were completed, guaranteeing the feasibility of the study, the team went to Madeira Carlton hotel divepoint, where tests were conducted to evaluate the estimation quality of the proposed solution under water by a professional diver (figure \ref{fig:underwater}). A 5-meter square net being held by two people above water served as guideline for the diver performing the experiment underwater. The diver held the spherical housing while swimming along the guideline maintaining a constant speed while slowly increasing depth (figure \ref{fig:underwater_2}).
